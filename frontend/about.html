          <p>
            The computing and information disciplines are relatively young. Yet
            despite their comparative youth, these disciplines have had an
            unparalleled effect on almost every aspect of contemporary life. It
            is the express purpose of Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE) to promote the
            computing and information disciplines and to encourage their
            contribution to the enhancement of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p class="second-info">
            UPE was first organized at Texas A&M University, College Station,
            Texas, in 1967. The international honor society now consists of over
            300 chapters at various colleges and universities in North America
            and overseas.
